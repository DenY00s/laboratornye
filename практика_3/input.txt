This was a real value for money kit
from Revell, moulded on 12 sprues;
eleven in Grey and one in clear,
which displayed crisp detail and
very little evidence of flash. The
decal sheet contained markings
for two different units’ aircraft.
The first was US Navy PV-1 BuNo.
48895 of VP-133, based at Iwo
Jima in 1945, which carried the
well-known Octopus marking on its
spine. Secondly, there was a
US Navy PV-1 BuNo. 48891 of
VP-135, based at ATTU, Alaska,
in 1943. For this build the former
version was selected…who could
resist those tentacles?
After assembly of the cockpit
the airbrush was loaded with
Xtracrylix XA 1117 Interior Green,
and the whole area was given a
light coat. The instrument panel
and side consoles received Tamiya
XF-69 NATO Black, and were then
coated with a brushed-on layer of
Alclad Aqua Gloss. Instruments
were provided in decal form which,
given how much would be seen
through the glazing, were more
than adequate for the scale. Once
the instrument decal was placed
it was brushed with Tamiya X-20A
